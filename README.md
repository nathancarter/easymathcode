# easymathcode

This project makes it easy to edit a document in a browser, and
that document can contain mathematics (typeset by
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)), code (syntax highlighted by
[highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/)), and even executable
math code (using [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/)).

Thanks to all the projects I leveraged to throw this together!
