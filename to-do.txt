Since each of the following items will require a nicer UI, rewrite
the existing tool to import Bootstrap and jQuery, making the
following steps easier.

Have the page constantly saving the files to your HTML local
storage, with keys based on the first 100 characters or something,
and an expiry date.  Then there should be a "Recents" button that
allows you to browse the content of recent auto-saves into that
storage, and reload one.

Make a button for copying all the HTML to the clipboard, for easy
pasting into a blog post or WordPress page, for instance.
